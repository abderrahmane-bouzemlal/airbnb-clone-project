## 🧩 Feature Breakdown

### 👤 User Management

Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management. Supports both **guests** and **hosts**, allowing users to log in securely, manage their profiles, and access role-specific features.

### 🏠 Property Management

Enables hosts to create, update, and manage property listings. Each listing includes a title, description, location, price, and availability—forming the core of the rental marketplace.

### 📅 Booking System

Allows guests to book available properties for selected dates. The system manages availability checks, booking statuses (pending, confirmed, canceled), and check-in/check-out details.

### 💳 Payment Processing

Handles transactions linked to bookings. Integrates with third-party providers (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) for secure and seamless payment processing.

### ⭐ Review System

Lets users leave reviews and ratings for properties they’ve stayed at. This feature enhances trust and transparency for future guests.

### 🧾 API Documentation

Backend features are documented using the OpenAPI standard for REST and optionally exposed via GraphQL. This ensures easy integration and flexibility for the frontend.

### 🚀 Performance Optimization

Implements caching and indexing to optimize database performance and speed up frequent queries. This keeps the user experience fast and responsive.

## 🔐 API Security

Securing the API is essential for protecting data, preventing abuse, and ensuring platform integrity. Key security measures include:

### 🔑 Authentication

**What it is:** Verifies the identity of users accessing the API via **JWT** or **Token-based Authentication**.
**Why it matters:** Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive user and platform data.

---

### 🛡️ Authorization

**What it is:** Manages role-based access and actions at the API level.
**Why it matters:** Ensures users can only access and modify their own data and resources.

---

### ⚠️ Rate Limiting & Throttling

**What it is:** Limits request frequency using Django REST Framework’s throttling policies.
**Why it matters:** Prevents abuse, brute-force attacks, and maintains API performance.

---

### 🔒 Data Protection & Encryption

**What it is:** Encrypts data in transit (HTTPS/TLS) and securely hashes passwords. Environment variables store sensitive config.
**Why it matters:** Safeguards personal data and protects against interception and leaks.

---

### 💳 Secure Payment Handling

**What it is:** Leverages trusted providers like Stripe or PayPal for all transactions. No sensitive payment data is stored.
**Why it matters:** Reduces liability and ensures industry-standard payment security.

---

### 🧪 Input Validation & Error Handling

**What it is:** Validates all user input and handles errors gracefully across frontend and backend.
**Why it matters:** Prevents injection attacks (SQL, XSS) and avoids exposing system internals.

---

## ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?

**CI/CD** stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment/Delivery**. It automates testing, building, and deploying new code to ensure fast and reliable software delivery.

---

### Why It Matters for This Project

In a full-stack platform like this:

* Every commit is automatically tested for quality and security.
* Bugs are caught early via automated test pipelines.
* Deployments are consistent across development, staging, and production environments.
* Releases are faster, safer, and less error-prone.

---

### Tools Used

* **GitHub Actions** – For automating tests, builds, and deployments.
* **Docker** – Ensures consistent environments in containers.
* **Docker Compose** – Manages multi-container stacks (backend, frontend, DB, etc.).
* **Heroku / AWS / DigitalOcean** – Platforms for deploying the live application.
* **PostgreSQL / Redis** – Replicated in CI environments for testing.
* **pytest / Django Test Suite** – Backend unit and integration tests.
* **Jest / Cypress** – Frontend unit, E2E, and integration testing tools.

---

### Example CI/CD Workflow

1. **Push to GitHub** triggers GitHub Actions.
2. **Lint and run tests** on frontend and backend.
3. **Build Docker images** and publish to registry.
4. **Deploy to staging** automatically or to production after manual approval.
5. **Run health checks** and send notifications (e.g., Slack, email).
